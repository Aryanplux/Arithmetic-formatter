#Arithmetic Formatter
Welcome to my Arithmetic Formatter project! ðŸŽ‰

About the Project
This is a mini Python project where I built a program to neatly format and display simple arithmetic problems. It's a fun exercise in working with strings, logic, and basic Python skills.

Key Features
Formats arithmetic problems in a clean and readable way.
Supports addition and subtraction operations.
Handles multiple problems at once, with proper alignment.
Purpose
This project is just for fun and a way to practice Python coding! Itâ€™s perfect for anyone learning programming and wanting to see a practical use case of string manipulation and formatting.

How It Works
You provide the program with a list of arithmetic problems (like "32 + 8" or "45 - 12"), and it formats them like this:

diff
Copy
Edit
  32      45
+  8    - 12
